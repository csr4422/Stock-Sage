# Stock Sage
Welcome to the Stock Market Price Predictor (Stock sage)! This application predicts stock market prices using historical data and APIs. Built with Streamlit for the user interface, the project fetches live stock market data using APIs and provides predictions.


# About the Project
The Stock Market Price Predictor leverages data from stock market APIs to predict future prices based on historical trends. The project is designed to help users predict price movements of stocks, enabling better investment decisions.

Using Streamlit, this project provides a user-friendly interface where users can:

Make predictions about future stock prices.
The stock price prediction is powered by an API called FB Prophet that uses machine learning models trained on historical data, which can predict future stock trends based on factors like previous price movements.
